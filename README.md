## 📖 About the Project
This is a **Movie Recommendation System** built in **C++**, utilizing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** instead of AI/ML models. The system loads movies from a dataset (`cleaned_movies.csv`) and allows filtering based on **genre, rating, runtime, and other criteria** using efficient DSA techniques like **Treaps**.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Filter movies by rating** (0 to 10)
✅ **Filter by genre** (Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.)
✅ **Filter by rating & genre** (e.g., Action movies with a rating above 8)
✅ **Filter by runtime** (30 to 300 minutes)
✅ **Treap-based sorting** for optimized filtering
✅ **Command-line interface for easy interaction**

## 📌 Usage
1️⃣ **Select a filtering option** (rating, genre, runtime, etc.)  
2️⃣ **Enter the required inputs** (e.g., min rating, genre name)  
3️⃣ **Get top recommended movies** based on your selection  
4️⃣ **Enjoy!** 🎬 🍿

## 🏆 Algorithms & Data Structures Used
- **Treap (Tree + Heap)** for managing top-rated movies efficiently
- **Sorting & Searching Algorithms** for optimized filtering
- **File Handling** to process the dataset (`cleaned_movies.csv`)
